# data-engineering-toolkit

This repository documents my journey to becoming a professional data engineer through the **DE Launchpad** program by the **Data Engineering Community (DEC)**. DEC is a global community where aspiring and experienced data engineers connect to foster growth, while the DE Launchpad is a free, virtual, hands-on mentorship program designed to help beginners gain practical experience, build job-ready skills, and launch meaningful careers.

Through the program’s project- and research-based learning approach, I will share:

- The projects I’m working on

- Additional resources I’m consulting to deepen my understanding

- Reflections and insights from my learning journey

This repo serves both as my personal learning log and as a resource for others on a similar path.
